# Course Simulator
The program is a course simulator where users can create and take different courses and get evaluated for them. We chose to create this program as it felt relevant as we are all students and the subject matter felt familiar!

#Set up (Windows)

download the version above all the default settings that the installer provides ensuring that the configuration is typical and when it asks for a root password please type 
coursesimgroup. After you have successfully installed the server login to the mysQl command  using the root password and carry out the following commands (press enter after each semicolon). This may vary depending on the device, it is important however that this server is installed before attempting use and that the mentioned password is used!

## Commands (In Order):

- Create database course_simulator;

- use course_simulator;

- create table students (StudentID Varchar(25), Password Varchar(25), CourseID Varchar(25), CourseGrade float);

- create table courses (CourseID Varchar(25), PrerequisiteCourseID Varchar(25), PrerequisiteGrade float, Question Varchar(250), Answer Varchar(250), Points int);

- create table sessioncourse (CourseID Varchar(25), Question Varchar(250), Answer Varchar(250), Points int);

- create table sessionstudent (StudentID Varchar(25), CourseID Varchar(25), CourseGrade float);

- Show tables;  (use this command to confirm that the above tables were made successfully!)

This is a course simulator in which the user can pick between an instructor mode and a student mode.

In instructor mode, the user can create a course. They must give a course code, prerequisites, questions, answers and their corresponding number of points. Then that specific course is saved. 


In the student mode, the student must input a unique username and a password which creates a student account. They can go to the login screen and log in to this new account using the username and password.

 The student is then able to see a list of all the courses. The student can choose to enroll in a course, however, they must meet the prerequisites to do that, if they donâ€™t, they are not allowed to enroll.

 Once the student picks a course, they can answer questions and then the course is evaluated for a grade.

## User stories
- The user can create different student users that will have their own respective data on how they performed in different courses
- The user can log in to a created student user using a unique username and a password
- The user can create a course with a unique course id that may or may not have a prerequisite but will have questions and answers (as well as points assigned to them)
- The user can enrol in a course that they have the appropriate prerequisites for
- The user can run a course and answer its questions
- the user can evaluate their course and see what grade they got for that attempt
  
## Packaging
The different files are separated by what layer they fall in according to the clean architecture guidelines  and are further divided by what feature they are specifically needed for.

## Design Patterns and choices
We implemented a factory design patterns so that our program could potentially be extended and future subclasses of our courses, prerequisites or student entities can be incorporated and it also allowed for greater separation between our layers.

We included a builder design pattern for the creation of our courses as the courses are containing both questions and prerequisites which both require different methods to construct so it felt cleaner to implement this design pattern for this more complex class.

We also implemented an iterator design pattern within our course class as we needed a way to seamlessly iterate through the questions so that they can be presented to the user so they can answer them.

We used mock gateways so that we could test our interactors without causing issues to our set-up databases.
